ADDITIONAL HOTEL API INTEGRATIONS (MULTI-API ARCHITECTURE): Implement a flexible multi-API provider system with automatic fallback and load balancing to ensure maximum uptime, best pricing, and widest inventory coverage. The system should support the following APIs with priority-based selection: PRIMARY API: RateHawk API (2.6M+ properties in 220+ countries with competitive B2B rates, fast response times <1s, multi-room booking, pre-book validation, real-time availability). SECONDARY APIS: (1) Amadeus Hotel API: Access to 1.5M+ properties in 190+ countries, enterprise-grade reliability, AI-powered recommendations, dynamic pricing, multi-currency support for 40+ currencies, multi-language support, comprehensive property details with high-quality images, real-time availability and booking, advanced search filters, detailed reporting and analytics, seamless integration with existing systems, pre-paid and post-paid booking options, cancellation and modification support, loyalty program integration, GDS connectivity for global distribution. (2) Expedia Hotel API (Rapid API): Access to 700,000+ properties worldwide, competitive commission-based pricing, extensive hotel inventory with real-time availability, comprehensive property details including images policies amenities, flexible API endpoints for personalized experiences, fast response times with reliable uptime, package deals and bundle offers, loyalty program integration with Expedia Rewards, multi-currency and multi-language support, secure payment processing, real-time booking confirmations, cancellation management with refund processing. (3) Booking.com API (if available): Direct access to Booking.com inventory, authentic reviews and ratings from real guests, best price guarantee options, genius loyalty program integration, flexible cancellation policies, instant booking confirmations, mobile-optimized booking flow. (4) HotelBeds API: Over 180,000 properties in 24,000+ destinations, exclusive B2B rates with negotiated pricing, unique boutique and independent hotels, complete hotel content with images and amenities, real-time availability and instant confirmation, multi-room booking support, special offers and last-minute deals, API caching for faster response, comprehensive search filters by location/price/rating/amenities. (5) Agoda Partner API: Strong coverage in Asia-Pacific region, competitive pricing for Asian markets, exclusive deals and promotions, real-time rate updates, hotel reviews and ratings, multi-language support focusing on Asian languages, secure booking and payment processing, loyalty rewards integration. MULTI-API STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION: API Aggregation Layer: Build a unified abstraction layer that normalizes responses from all APIs into a single consistent format, create adapter pattern for each API provider with standardized interfaces, implement response mapping to convert different API schemas to your internal data model, handle API-specific authentication and headers centrally, centralize error handling with provider-specific retry logic. Intelligent API Selection Logic: Primary search strategy - query RateHawk first for best B2B rates and fast response, fallback mechanism - if RateHawk fails or has no results query Amadeus then Expedia then HotelBeds then Agoda in sequence, price comparison mode - query multiple APIs in parallel and show best price from all providers with "Best Price Guarantee" badge, load balancing - distribute requests across APIs based on rate limits and response times to optimize performance, geographic optimization - prioritize APIs based on destination (e.g. Agoda for Asia RateHawk for Europe Expedia for Americas), availability check - use fastest API for initial search then validate with others for booking accuracy. Rate and Price Aggregation: Combine results from multiple APIs and deduplicate hotels using hotel mapping logic based on name address coordinates, price comparison display showing rates from different providers with "Price from RateHawk" or "Price from Amadeus" labels, best rate highlighting with visual indicator for cheapest option, real-time price updates from all connected APIs, dynamic rate adjustment based on demand and availability across providers, commission calculation per API provider for profit margin optimization. Performance Optimization for Multi-API: Parallel API calls using Promise.all() or async/await for faster response times, API response caching in Redis with different TTL per provider (RateHawk 5min Amadeus 10min Expedia 15min), request batching to minimize redundant calls when searching multiple destinations, response time tracking per API with automatic routing to fastest provider, circuit breaker pattern to temporarily disable slow or failing APIs and route traffic to healthy ones, API health monitoring dashboard showing uptime response times error rates for each provider, retry queue for failed booking requests with exponential backoff, webhook listeners for async updates from each API provider. API Quota and Cost Management: Track API usage per provider with daily monthly limits display, quota alerts when approaching rate limits to prevent overages, cost calculation dashboard showing API expenses per provider per booking, automatic switching to cheaper API when quota is low on expensive provider, preferential routing based on commission rates and profit margins, dynamic API selection based on real-time cost analysis and conversion rates. Unified Booking Flow Across APIs: Pre-booking validation to check availability and price across selected API before final confirmation, booking request queue with retry logic if primary API fails switch to secondary API automatically, booking confirmation from multiple sources with provider name clearly displayed, cancellation handling that routes request to correct API provider based on original booking source, refund processing with provider-specific policies and timelines, booking modification support with API compatibility checks, multi-room booking coordination when rooms come from different API providers bundle into single order. Content Synchronization Strategy: Daily sync of hotel content from all APIs using Content APIs (RateHawk Content API Amadeus Hotel List API Expedia Property API HotelBeds Content API), incremental updates to keep database fresh with latest property information amenities policies photos, image
